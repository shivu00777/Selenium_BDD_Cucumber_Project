Prerequisites
Before running the tests, make sure you have the following installed on your system:


bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/naaptol-automation.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd naaptol-automation
Import the project into your IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ) as a Maven project.

Run the following Maven command to install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Running the Tests
To execute the test scenarios, run the following command from the project root directory:

bash
Copy code
mvn test
Alternatively, you can run specific feature files using the Cucumber plugin in your IDE.

Project Structure
src/test/java/ – Contains the step definitions and hooks.
src/test/resources/features/ – Holds the Cucumber feature files.
src/main/resources/ – Configuration files, such as property files, can be placed here.
src/test/resources/extent-config.xml – Configuration for generating the Extent Report.
Feature Files
The feature files are located in the src/test/resources/features folder. Each feature file contains scenarios related to different functionalities in the 'Mobile and Tablets' section.

Example of a scenario in MobileTablets.feature:

gherkin
Copy code
Feature: Mobile and Tablets functionality
  As a user, I want to browse the mobile and tablet section and add products to the cart

  Scenario: Add a mobile phone to the cart
    Given I navigate to the "Mobile and Tablets" section
    When I select a mobile phone
    And I add it to the cart
    Then I should see the product in the cart
Extent Reports
The Extent Report is generated after running the tests and can be found in the target/ folder. To view the report:

Open the ExtentReport.html file in your browser.
GitHub
Once the project is complete, push the code to your GitHub repository:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for Naaptol Mobile and Tablets automation"
git push origin main
